Geographical CVOC Extension
===========================

Extend with improved 'CVOC' funcionalities for the dataset metadata input of a location by the placename as text. 
Instead of just free text we use Geonames service to retrieve the name and it's ID. 


__NOTE__ The geonames services can do a lot more than lookup names and also has coordinates of places.
