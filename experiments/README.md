# Experiments for extending

The goal of these experiments is to try if we can extend the Dataverse functionality for geographic information handling. 

1. [Map view extention](./MapViewExtention.md)
   
   Extend with a search results display showing the geographical locations on an interactive map. 
   Using the 'old' Dataverse version 6.2+, with JavaScript (jQuery) and the Leaflet geographical map library. 

2. Extend with improved 'CVOC' funcionalities for the dataset metadata input of a location by the placename as text. 
   Instead of just free text we use Geonames service to retrieve the name and it's ID.
